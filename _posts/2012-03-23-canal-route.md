## Canal Route Android app: now available!

Our first mobile app for Android is available in the [Google Play store] (http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.android)!

*Canal Route* lets you know which lift bridges are up and which lift bridges are down along the Welland Canal. Very
helpful when you're in a rush!

You can [download it now] (http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.android), or check out the 
[Resounding Software Apps site] (http://apps.resounding.ca).
